# CoffeeMachine

Simple Program that allows you to decice what kind of hot beverage you'd like chosing between espresso/cappuccino/latte, 
keeps track of resources (water/milk/coffee),
allows you to insert coins (quarters/dimes/nickles/pennies),
gives you the change if the money inserted was enough and gives you the beverage you wanted!
You can ask for a "report" to see the resources still available and the profit generated.
Also with "off" you can shut down the machine.
